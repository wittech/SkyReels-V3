  ```

> 💡 **Notes:**
> * The `--task_type` parameter must be set to `single_shot_extension`.
> * The `--input_video` parameter specifies the source video to be extended. Since the **single_shot_extension** model supports extensions of 5 to 30 seconds, the `--duration` parameter accepts an integer value within this range.

##### B. Shot Switching Video Extension (Cinematic Transitions)
Supports transitions like "Cut-In", "Cut-Out", "Shot/Reverse Shot", etc. (Limited to 5s).
- **Single-GPU Inference:**
  ```bash
  python3 generate_video.py --task_type shot_switching_extension --input_video https://skyreels-api.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/examples/video_extension/test.mp4 --prompt "[ZOOM_IN_CUT] The scene cuts from a medium shot of a visually impaired man walking on a path in a park. The shot then cut in to a close-up of the man's face and upper torso. The visually impaired Black man is shown from the chest up, wearing dark sunglasses, a grey turtleneck scarf, and a light olive green jacket. His head is held straight, looking forward towards the camera, continuing his walk. The lighting is natural and bright. The background is a soft blur of green trees and foliage from the park." --offload
  ```
- **Multi-GPU Inference (xDiT USP):**
  ```bash
  torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 generate_video.py --task_type shot_switching_extension --input_video https://skyreels-api.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/examples/video_extension/test.mp4 --prompt "[ZOOM_IN_CUT] The scene cuts from a medium shot of a visually impaired man walking on a path in a park. The shot then cut in to a close-up of the man's face and upper torso. The visually impaired Black man is shown from the chest up, wearing dark sunglasses, a grey turtleneck scarf, and a light olive green jacket. His head is held straight, looking forward towards the camera, continuing his walk. The lighting is natural and bright. The background is a soft blur of green trees and foliage from the park." --offload --use_usp
  ```

> 💡 **Notes:**
> * The `--task_type` parameter must be set to `shot_switching_extension`.
> * The `--input_video` parameter specifies the source video to be extended, and the `--duration` parameter is therefore limited to a maximum of 5 seconds.
> * To effectively utilize the supported cinematography types ("Cut-In", "Cut-Out", "Shot/Reverse Shot", "Multi-Angle", "Cut Away"), you can use a Large Language Model (LLM) to craft and optimize your generation prompts, ensuring clear and precise creative direction.

#### 3. Talking Avatar

### 📉 Memory Optimization (Low VRAM)
For GPUs with lower VRAM (e.g., under 24GB), use these options:
- Add the `--low_vram` flag to enable FP8 weight-only quantization and block offload.
- Lower the output `--resolution` (default is `720P`; try `540P` or `480P`).

Example:
```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True" && python3 generate_video.py --low_vram --resolution 540P ...
```
